Multitude started as something else, in more ways than one. I've been trying to write a music app based on other people's api's for a while and never quite manage to get things finished. In the meantime I've been using other services and always get frustrated by the little things. I've also been an avid user of Thomas101's [WMail](https://thomas101.github.io/wmail/) (now [WaveBox](https://wavebox.io/)) â€“ an app that adds a slim wrapper around existing email services (Google's Gmail/Inbox). I applied that concept to the music streaming services I use all the time.

Multitude is the result.
