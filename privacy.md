Multitude may collect the following information about you in order to help understand the audience.

# Using the app
When you use Multitude it sends some anonymised usage information that is used by developer to measure how many people use the app. Multitude uses Google Analytics to collect this information. When sending usage information, no personal information about the user, the users emails or users data is monitored. The typical information that Multitude sends for measurement is:

* The version of Multitude you’re using (e.g. 1.3.7)
* The language of the operating system (e.g. en_US)
* The type of operating system being used (e.g. windows, darwin, linux)
* The size of the Multitude window
* The IP address of the collection request can be used to derive the rough geographical region (e.g. USA, UK etc)

It’s important to emphasise that no personal information or information about your accounts is collected. The collected analytics are only used to help the developer fix and improve the application.

Multitude provides access to Music streaming services such as Deezer and Spotify in a similar way to your web browser. The information that they collect and the privacy policies they use are separate and in no way associated with Multitude.

Reporting a bug
When reporting a bug/issue, you are using Github therefore the information they collect about you is different and can be found on their Privacy Policy page.
